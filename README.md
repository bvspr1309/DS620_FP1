Data Visualization final project
Financial porfolio apps are in high demand in sotck market.

Evenythough there are numerous apps that are already available providing similar functions new applications still roll in to the market and become popular based on the customer/application support provided, user friendly features, scalability and adaptability of the application.

Due to the complexity of most of the applications that puts beginner investors in confusion applications with simple features such as portfolio tracking, performance analysis, risk assessment, asset allocation, and benchmark comparisons are in constant demand.

Our project is to make an application with such simple but necessary features.

We created a simple data set with top 50 active stocks and made a financlial portfolio dashboard using streamlit.
